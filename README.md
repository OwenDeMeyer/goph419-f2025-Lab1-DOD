This code was used to create definitions for sine and inverse sine functions without relying on mathematical libraries 
that can be imported to use these functions. Then the next code was to calculate launch angles of a rocket (defined as Launch_angle_range) using the functions for sine and the inverse 
sine functions that were coded. afterward a main function was created to plot the max and min launch angles with specific variables set. This was done in driver.py. 
To run this code NumPy matplotlib and python must be installed. This can be done through a terminal of your choice in a virtual environment. To get access to the code, use git clone, followed by the link of this page, and use git pull to extract any more changes to this code. Then once you have connected to this code, use the command line: py -m examples.driver 
This will call upon the main function and display two figures of the data plotted. These figures will then be saved in a folder called figures as a png file. if there is no file called figures, it will still display them but the figures will not be saved.
